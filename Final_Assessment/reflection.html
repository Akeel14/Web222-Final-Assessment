                        <h3>The Concept of Responsive Design</h3>
                        <p>
                            Responsive Design is the design approach used to display the same content of a webpage or an app That is appropriate for that particular device such as a desktop, tablet, smartphone etc. Responsive design takes the use of media queries and other elements to display. Responsive design is an essential part of developing any application because when creating an app you have to take into account the multitude of different devices out there. Without responsive design, it would be impossible to display content effectively across different devices. Which you would then have to develop a website for mobile and a separate website for desktop. Which will only make the development process a hassle.

                        <h3>How does responsive design relate to web technologies?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Responsive web design is very a very important part of the web. Currently, 50% of the web is accessed via mobile while 46% is accessed via desktop. That is a fairly even spilt if you were to not make your webpage responsive. You would automatically be losing half of the potential users that could be on your website because your user would not have the best experience browsing on a website that is only made for desktop or visa-versa. Another reason why you should use responsive websites is that it will help to improve your user visits and the time they spend on the site which in turn increases your ranking in various search engines. Furthermore, Responsive web designs help to drive down the cost of managing websites because you wouldn't need to manage a website for desktop and one for mobile.In conclusion, responsive designs really help increase productivity when creating websites for many reasons and it is highly recommended to use this technique when creating even a simple webpage.

                            What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research?
                        </h3>
                        <p>Throughout my research, I learned that when building web apps that the first step when building web apps is to plan your design for each device first. Figure out how you will design your web app for all the different devices out there such as desktop, tablet, mobile, etc. The second thing I learned is that looking at other popular web apps on various devices to see how to did their responsive web design. This will help you grasp the understanding of how proper web apps are built on different devices. Another thing is that if you use a common and less complicated approach when building web apps it will more likely be familiar to the user which in turn will make them have a better experience while using your website. Thirdly, when building a web app it is best practice to consider a mobile-first approach start from developing the website for mobile users and then scale up because this is the most difficult part to work with and if you are able to successfully produce a mobile version in responsive design it is fairly simple for your webpage to adapt to other screen sizes.</p>

                        <p>My overall experience in this course was very enriching. I learned a lot of interesting introductory things about the web like HTML5 elements tags, and attributes, CSS styling for webpages, and basic javascript for validating a user form. These were just some of the many things I learned in the past few months of taking this course and I cannot wait to continue my journey into learning web development.</p>
